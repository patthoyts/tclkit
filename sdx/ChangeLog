2005-11-19  jcw

2005-11-17  jcw
   * main.tcl: Added a check that Tclkit >= 8.4.9 is being used, otherwise
     we assume we use an older version of the "starkit" package which does
     not correctly detect the "sourced" startup if the starkit is symlinked.
     The workaround always allows command-line mode, even if < 8.4.9 so that
     SDX remains usable with all Tclkit's out there.  Thx, D. Sanderson.
